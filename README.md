### **Project: Financial Performance Analysis** ðŸ’°

---

### **Project Objective**

The objective of this project was to design and implement a **financial analytics solution** that delivers deep insights into the companyâ€™s profitability, sales performance, and market trends. Using a **Star Schema data model**, **Power Query**, and **Power Pivot**, I built dynamic reports such as **Profit & Loss (P&L) statements, Market vs. Target performance, and Customer Performance Reports**.

The solution transformed raw financial data into a **centralized, interactive reporting system** that empowered stakeholders with accurate, actionable insights.

### **Purpose & Importance**

This project plays a vital role in ensuring **financial transparency** and driving **data-driven decision-making**:

* **Monitor Profitability** â€“ P&L statements provide clear visibility into revenues, costs, and margins across months, fiscal years, and markets.
* **Assess Performance** â€“ Market and customer performance reports highlight top vs. underperforming areas.
* **Support Strategic Decisions** â€“ Growth, margin, and target comparisons enable informed leadership decisions on pricing, resourcing, and market focus.
* **Ensure Data Integrity** â€“ Power Query transformations (cleaning, standardization, handling negative values) ensured reliable financial reporting.

This shifted the organization from **reactive reporting** to **proactive strategy execution**.
